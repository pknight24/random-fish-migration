# COMAP2020: A Random Walk Through the North Sea

This repository contains code and data for our submission to the 2020 COMAP Mathematical Contest in Modeling. We used time-varying Markov chains to predict changes in fish migration in the sea regions surrounding Scotland.

The code used to run the simulations is found in the `src` directory. `2020105.pdf` is our final submission.
